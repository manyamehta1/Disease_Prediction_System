# Disease_Prediction_System
I purposed the utilization of predictive modeling techniques, specifically machine learning (ML) approaches, to identify diseases based on patient symptoms as input data. 
By implementing Naive Bayes and Random Forest methodologies, we aim to explore their effectiveness in disease prediction.
analyze vast amounts of patient data, including symptoms, medical history, and test results,
to uncover hidden patterns and make accurate predictions. By training on labeled datasets,
ML models can learn the relationships between symptoms and specific diseases, enabling the
development of predictive models. Two commonly used ML algorithms in healthcare are
Naive Bayes and Random Forest. Naive Bayes is a probabilistic algorithm that utilizes
Bayes' theorem to calculate the conditional probability of a disease given the observed
symptoms. 


1).Data Collection: We gather a comprehensive dataset consisting of patient symptoms,
medical history, and relevant clinical information. The dataset should include labeled
instances where the presence orabsence of specific diseases is known.

2).Data Preprocessing: The collected data is preprocessed to ensure its quality and
suitability for the machine learning algorithms. This step involves handling missing
values, normalizing or scaling numeric features, and encoding categorical variables.

3).Feature Selection: To optimize the performance of our predictive model, we employ
feature selection techniques to identify the most relevant symptoms for disease
prediction. This helps in reducing dimensionality and focusing on the most
informative features.

4).Model Training: We divide the preprocessed dataset into training and testing sets.
The training set is used to train the Naive Bayes and Random Forest models. During
this stage, the algorithms learn the patterns and relationships between symptoms and
diseases from the labeled data.

5).Model Evaluation: The trained models are evaluated using various performance
metrics such as sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and area under the receiver
operating characteristic curve (AUC- ROC). These metrics provide insights into the
predictive capabilities of the models and their ability to correctly classify instances.

6). Model Comparison: We compare the performance of the Naive Bayes and Random
Forest models to assess their effectiveness in disease prediction. This analysis helps us
determine which algorithm performs better in terms of accuracy and robustness.

7).Predictive Disease Modeling: Once the models are trained and evaluated, they can be
utilized to predict diseases based on new patient symptom data. The models take the
input of symptoms and provide predictions regarding the likelihood of specific
diseases.
